### Learning Elixir (programming language)

I know very little about the Elixir programming language. This document will go over all of my knowledge of the Elixir programming language.

#### Hello World in Elixir

This is how you make a Hello World program in Elixir:

```elixir
iex> IO.puts("Hello World!")
```

#### Comments in Elixir

Comments in Elixir are the same as in Shell.

##### Single line comments

Single line comments in Elixir are written like so:

```elixir
# This is a single line comment
```

##### Multi-line comments

I don't know if Elixir supports multi-line comments.

#### Break keyword in Elixir

```elixir
break
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

##### The IEX shell

Elixir commonly uses the `iex` shell to run commands.

The shell can be invoked with the following command:

```elixir
iex>
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

##### Modules in Elixir

Elixir makes use of modules. They can be created like so:

```elixir
defmodule Fibonacci do
  def fib(0), do: 0
  def fib(1), do: 1
  def fib(n), do: fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)  
end
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Other knowledge of the Elixir programming language

1. Elixir is a language by an unknown developer

2. Elixir is not a semicolon and curly bracket language, but it is a curly bracket language

3. Elixir uses the `*.ex` file extension by default, but also uses the `*.exs` file extension

4. The `*.ex` file extension can be confused with a Euphoria (another programming language) program.

5. Elixir is built upon the Erlang programming language

6. Several major programs and platforms make heavy use of Elixir, including Discord and Pinterest

7. Elixir is not one of the top 50 programming languages (as of 2022, July 31st, it has never ranked 50 or higher on the TIOBE index)

8. Elixir was first created in the year 2012

9. No other knowledge of the Elixir programming language

#### Additional comments

1. I have not yet memorized the names of the developers

2. No other additional comments available
